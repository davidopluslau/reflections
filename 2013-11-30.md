Fernando's lecture on Tuesday was absolutely stellar. I was literally on the edge of my seat for the entire presentation. I almost blew a blood vessel from how awesome the interactive parameter shifting demonstration in iPython was. Learning about the creation, community around, and capabilities of iPython was seriously cool. It made me wonder why EVERYONE hasn't already switched to it.

I also wondered: why wasn't this in the first week? Maybe there was a scheduling conflict, which is completely reasonable. But we definitely could have used this before any of the earthquake lectures. All of the earthquake lectures were unnecessary before the homework assignments we had; they only had any importance for the current project, they could have been given just-in-time. I believe that had we had this lecture earlier, we could have seen the benefits of working exclusively in iPython and chosen to use it as an investment, preventing language fragmentation.
